# Hamming Code Correction Simulator

It's a Hamming Code Correction simulator as the name suggests. It's for my Data Communications lecture assignment. So I intended to achieve just the functionality. I'm gonna refactor this repo some time in the future for code quality.

It's a standart Spring Boot app. Clone and run as always.
